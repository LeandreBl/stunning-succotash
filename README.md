# Stunning-succotash
##### (does not mean anything)
### This script allows you to export directly the presences of your students from their Microsoft Teams attendance sheet.

> Simply export the student list from the intranet activity

> Get the attendance list from your Teams meeting

```sh
$ ./stunning-succotash.py "[B-ABC-123][ABC-X-X]_Activity_name.csv" "meetingAttendanceList.csv"
```
> It does not create a file on it's own, to avoid passing too many arguments, so feel free to redirect the output with a `> file.csv` to fill a file with the output.
